# Social-Media-Dashboard

Introduction

Your task is to build a Social Media Dashboard that allows users to manage their social media accounts, schedule posts, and track their social media performance. The application should use third-party APIs to fetch social media data, allow users to schedule and publish posts, and use the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js).

Requirements

The application should meet the following requirements:


User authentication: Users should be able to sign up, log in, and log out of the application using their email address and password.

Social media integration: The application should integrate with at least one social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, and allow users to view their social media feeds and post content to their accounts.

Post scheduling: Users should be able to schedule posts for a future date and time, and the application should automatically post the content at the scheduled time.



Performance tracking: Users should be able to track their social media performance, such as the number of followers, likes, comments, and shares on posts 

React component usage: The application should include at least two custom React components that are well-designed and provide a clear and concise user interface.

In your submitted application, the user should be able to log in to your application, connect to any social media platform, and view all of the posts from that account after connecting.
[The functionality should work, no fancy user interface is necessary.]
